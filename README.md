# Xcode Snippets

A bunch of Objective-C code snippets [originally by Mattt Thompson](https://github.com/mattt/Xcode-Snippets), converted to `.codesnippet` for easy installation.

## Using Snippets

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/
cd ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/
git clone https://github.com/Ashton-W/Xcode-Snippets.git .
```

If you have your own snippets already, you'll want to move them out then back in. You can even fork this repo.

Alternatively, use the [**Install System Plugin** tool](https://github.com/n-b/InstallSystemPlugins) and double-click the codesnippet files.
